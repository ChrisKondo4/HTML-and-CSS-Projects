# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Here is my repository I used as an example for my learning HTML and CSS.

There's a good amount of stuff here, but my most advanced projects in this repository are:

A "Top 5 Numbers" website I used for practicing relative links, image and video embedding, and creating a form: https://github.com/Killiest/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/One-Page%20Website

Space Station website I that contains animated image containers and more advanced CSS: https://github.com/Killiest/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Project/Space-Station

Movie Theatre website that I used for practicing Bootstrap: https://github.com/Killiest/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/bootstrap4_project
